# An educational memory game involving flipping cards from words ore sentence

## Setup:

A sequence of cards is laid out face down. Each card displays a character or word, forming part of a sequence or list that the player has previously entered. The number of cards corresponds to the number of characters or words entered by the player.

## Game Objective:

The goal is to flip the cards in the correct order that matches the sequence of words or characters entered. For example, if the entered sequence was "apple," "orange," "banana," and "!", the player must flip the cards in that exact order, including any characters, to win the game.

## How to Play:

**Input the Word or Sentence:** The player must enter a word or sentence in the text box to start the game. The input cannot be empty.

   **Card Generation and Shuffling:** The game will automatically generate cards based on the input and shuffle them randomly, placing them face down.

   **Start Flipping Cards:** The player begins by flipping the first card, aiming to reveal the first character or word in the sequence they entered.

   **Match the Sequence:** The player continues flipping cards in the correct order, attempting to match the sequence of characters or words they entered. If a wrong card is flipped, the player must try again until they run out of attempts, as given by the game.
   **Win Condition:** The game continues until all cards have been flipped in the correct order, matching the input word or sentence.

## Educational Value:

1- This version tests a player's ability to memorize and recall sequences.
2- It can help improve memory retention, particularly in scenarios where recalling the order of information is important (e.g., learning the steps of a process or remembering a list of items).
3- The simplicity of flipping the cards in order makes it ideal for younger learners or anyone practicing basic recall skills.

## Conclusion

This version emphasizes sequence recall rather than matching pairs. The goal is to test the player's ability to remember and follow the correct sequence of characters or words they previously entered. Each card corresponds to a part of that sequence, and the challenge is to flip the cards in the correct order.
